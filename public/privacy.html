    <h1>Privacy Policy - SpareTime</h1>

    <p>Last updated: <strong>2025-12-01</strong></p>

    <h2>Data access</h2>
    <p>SpareTime accesses only the following Google API scope when you opt in to cloud backup:</p>
    <p><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata</code></p>

    <p>This scope grants SpareTime access to the <strong>AppData</strong> folder in your Google Drive. The AppData folder is a special, hidden storage area intended for application-specific files. SpareTime only reads and writes files that it creates in that AppData folder.</p>

    <h2>Why the data is accessed</h2>
    <p>When you enable backup, SpareTime stores and retrieves your app data (task list, settings, and sync metadata) in the user's AppData folder so your tasks can be restored if you switch devices or reinstall the app. This enables two-way sync and optional backups.</p>

    <h2>What is NOT accessed or shared</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SpareTime does <strong>not</strong> access, list, or modify any of your other Drive files or folders.</li>
      <li>SpareTime does <strong>not</strong> share your data with third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where the data is stored</h2>
    <p>Backup files are stored in your Google Drive <em>AppData</em> folder. These files are associated with your Google account and are private to you and the app.</p>

    <h2>How to revoke access</h2>
    <p>You can revoke SpareTime's access at any time from your Google Account:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <strong>Google Account</strong> (https://myaccount.google.com)</li>
      <li>Go to <strong>Security</strong> → <strong>Third-party apps with account access</strong> (or <strong>Apps with access to your account</strong>)</li>
      <li>Find the SpareTime application and remove its access</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Revoking access stops future backups and syncs. If you want to remove previously stored AppData, you can do so within the app's settings page or contact us for assistance.</p>
